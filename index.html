        <p>Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively,
          “Disputes”) in which either Party seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of
          intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade
          secrets or patents, you and Group (i) waive your and Group’s respective rights to have any and all Disputes
          arising from or related to these Terms resolved in a court, and (ii) waive your and Group’s respective rights
          to a jury trial. Instead, you and Group will arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the
          referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding
          determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>Any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms is personal to you and Group and will be resolved solely
          through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type
          of representative proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual
          attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, a
          Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of
          arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>Process.</p>
        <p>Arbitration will be conducted confidentially. Any Dispute shall be referred to and finally resolved by
          arbitration administered by an arbitration body based in the Republic of Singapore pursuant to Article 110(1)
          of the Commercial Code Act of Singapore. It will be conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the
          Republic of Singapore, for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference in
          this clause. The seat of the arbitration shall be Republic of Singapore. The Tribunal shall consist of one (1)
          or three (3) arbitrator(s). The language of the arbitration shall be English. The Singapore judicial system
          will have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the</p>
        <p>enforcement of an arbitration award. All costs of Arbitration will be born and maintained by you. Authority
          of Arbitrator(s)</p>
        <p>As limited by these Terms and the applicable Commercial Code Act and Singapore Arbitraion rules, the
          arbitrator(s) will have (i) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive
          decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (ii) the
          authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the
          arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is
          prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator(s) may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not
          consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or
          preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</p>

        <p>Severability of Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Provisions.</p>
        <p>‍</p>

          minimum extent required by law, and all other terms, clauses and provisions of this Section will remain valid
          and enforceable. Further, the waivers set forth in this Section are severable from the other provisions of

          Singapore without regard to conflict of law rules or principles that would cause the application of the laws
          of any other jurisdiction. Any Dispute between the Parties arising out or relating to these Terms or its
          subject matter or formation (including non-contractual Disputes of claims) that is not subject to arbitration
          will be resolved in the courts of the Republic of Singapore.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>Severability</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>If any term, clause or provision of these Terms is held unlawful, void or unenforceable, then that term,
          clause or provision will be severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of

        <h3><strong>Act of God</strong></h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>K9 &#x27; performance under these Terms shall be excused if the failure of such performance is caused by
          forces beyond its reasonable control. This includes (but is not limited to) acts of God, acts of any
          government, war or civil unrest, severe weather, fire, natural disasters, political embargoes, terrorism,
          power or equipment failure, industrial or labor disputes or controversies, acts of any third party, or
          blockchain failures. Thus K9 is not liable for failure to perform solely caused by unavoidable force majeure
          casualty, acts by common carriers, emergency conditions, or any similar unforeseen event that renders
          performance commercially implausible.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>If such an event of force majeure occurs, the party injured by the other’s inability to perform may elect to
          suspend the Agreement, in whole or part, for the duration of the force majeure circumstances. The party
          experiencing the force majeure circumstances shall cooperate with and assist the injured party in all
          reasonable ways to minimize the impact of force majeure on the injured party.</p>

        <h3><strong>ACKNOWLEDGMENT and ASSUMPTION of RISKS</strong></h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p><strong>Certain Risk Factors Relating to Use, Acquisition and Use of K9 Tokens</strong></p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>Important Note: As noted elsewhere in these Terms, the K9 Tokens are not being structured or sold as
          securities or any other form of investment product. Accordingly, none of the information presented in this
          Exhibit C is intended to form the basis for any investment decision, and no specific recommendations are
          intended. Group expressly disclaims any and all responsibility for any direct or consequential loss or damage
          of any kind whatsoever arising directly or indirectly from: (i) reliance on any information contained in this
          Exhibit C, (ii) any error, omission or inaccuracy in any such information or (iii) any action resulting from
          such information.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>By purchasing, holding and using K9 Tokens, you expressly acknowledge and assume the following risks:</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h3><strong>Risk of Losing Access to K9 Tokens Due to Loss of Private Key(s)</strong></h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control and dispose of K9 Tokens stored in
          your digital wallet. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with your digital wallet storing
          K9 Tokens will result in loss of such K9 Tokens. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private
          key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet service you use, may be able to
          misappropriate your K9 Tokens.</p>
        <h3><strong>Risks Associated with the Protocol</strong></h3>
        <p>Because K9 Tokens and the Network are based on blockchain protocol(s0, any malfunction, breakdown or
          abandonment of the protocol may have a material adverse effect on the Network or K9 Tokens. Moreover, advances
          in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum</p>
        <p>computing, could present risks to the K9 Tokens and the Network by rendering ineffective the cryptographic
          consensus mechanism that underpins the Blockchain protocol.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h3><strong>Risk of Mining Attacks</strong></h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>As with other decentralized cryptographic K9 Tokens based on the Blockchain protocol, the K9 Tokens are
          susceptible to attacks by miners in the course of validating K9 transactions on the Blockchain blockchain,
          including, but not limited, to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, and selfish-mining
          attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Network and the K9 Tokens, including, but not limited
          to, accurate execution and recording of transactions involving K9 Tokens.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h3><strong>Risk of Hacking and Security Weaknesses</strong></h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Network or the K9 Tokens
          in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, treasury vulnerability, malware attacks, denial of
          service attacks, consensus-based attacks, man in the middle, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing.
          Furthermore, because the Network is based on open-source software, there is a risk that a third party or a
          member of the Group team may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core
          infrastructure of the Network, which could negatively affect the Network and the K9 Tokens.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>Hackers or other groups or organizations may attempt to steal revenue or Tokens, thus potentially impacting
          the ability of both K9 and K9 to develop the K9 network and Tokens, including the ability to operate the
          Network. To account for this risk, K9 has and will continue to implement comprehensive security precautions to
          safeguard the proceeds obtained from the exchange of K9 Tokens. Multi-factor security measures will be taken
          to protect all currencies and proceeds including physical elements, algorithms, multisignature keys,
          anti-spear-phishing procedures, splitting of funds, hot/cold wallet partitioning and diversification.
          Moreover, regular security audits of hot and cold wallets will be conducted by internal and external teams. As
          acknowledged, there is always a risk that the K9 Team, or other third parties not directly affiliated with the
          Parties, may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural
          elements of the K9 Platform causing the system to lose K9 Tokens stored in one or more User accounts or other
          accounts or lose sums of other valued K9 Tokens issued on the K9 Platform.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>K9 has taken steps to build, maintain, and secure the infrastructure of the K9 Platform, and will continue to
          do so. K9 intends to hire external consultants on a periodic basis to assess and audit the security of the K9
          Platform and will work with cryptography and security experts to develop and employ best practices to audit
          the Platform. As acknowledged by both parties, advances in code cracking, or technical advances such as the
          development of quantum computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the K9 Tokens Platform, which
          could result in the theft or loss of K9 Tokens or other valuable assets. To the extent possible, K9 intends to
          update the protocol underlying the K9 Platform to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate
          additional security measures, but it cannot predict the future of cryptography or the success of any future
          security updates. As with other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for the K9 Platform is susceptible to
          mining attacks, among others. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Blockchain Platform generally, and
          the K9 network specifically, effecting expected proper execution and sequencing of K9 Tokens transactions, and
          expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations, as well as other potential losses
          identified here as risk factors, in addition to those unidentified or unexpected. The Use of K9 Tokens</p>
        <p>carries with these significant risks. Prior to Use ofK9 Tokens, the User should carefully consider the risks
          herein identified, and, to the extent necessary, consult experts of your choosing ( cryptographic and cyber
          security specialists, lawyers, accountants, and/or other professionals) prior to determining whether to Use K9
          Tokens.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h3><strong>Risks Associated with Markets for K9 Tokens</strong></h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>K9 Tokens are intended to be used solely within the Network, and Group will not support or otherwise
          facilitate any secondary trading or external valuation of K9 Tokens. This restricts the contemplated avenues
          for using K9 Tokens to the provision or receipt of Services, and could therefore create illiquidity risk with
          respect to the K9 Tokens you hold. Even if secondary trading of K9 Tokens is facilitated by third party
          exchanges, such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight, making them
          more susceptible to fraud or manipulation.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>Furthermore, to the extent that third parties do ascribe an external exchange value to K9 Tokens (e.g., as
          denominated in a digital or fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile and diminish to zero.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h3><strong>Risk of Uninsured Losses</strong></h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, K9 Tokens are uninsured unless you
          specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value,
          there is no public insurer, such as the Deposit Insurance Corporation, or private insurance arranged by us, to
          offer recourse to you.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h3><strong>Risks Associated with Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions</strong></h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>The regulatory status of the K9 Tokens and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many
          jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation
          with respect to such technology and its applications, including the Network and the K9 Tokens. It is likewise
          difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and
          regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the Network and the K9
          Tokens. Regulatory actions could negatively impact the Network and the K9 Tokens in various ways, including,
          for purposes of illustration only, through a determination that K9 Tokens are a regulated financial instrument
          that require registration or licensing. Group may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that
          regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or
          commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h3><strong>Risks Arising from Taxation</strong></h3>
        <p>The tax characterization of K9 Tokens is uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice in connection with Use
          ofK9 Tokens, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including withholding taxes, income taxes
          and tax reporting requirements.</p>
        <h3><strong>Risk of Alternative Networks</strong></h3>
        <p>It is possible that alternative networks could be established that utilize the same open source code and</p>
        <p>protocol underlying the Network and attempt to facilitate services that are materially similar to the
          Services. The Network may compete with these alternative networks, which could negatively impact the Network
          and K9 Tokens.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h3><strong>Risk of Insufficient Interest in the Network or Distributed Applications</strong></h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>It is possible that the Network will not be used by a large number of individuals, companies and other
          entities or that there will be limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed
          ecosystems (such as the Network) more generally. Such a lack of use or interest could negatively impact the
          development of the Network and therefore the potential utility of K9 Tokens.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h3><strong>Risks Associated with the Development and Maintenance of the Network</strong></h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>The Network is still under development and may undergo significant changes over time. Although we intend for
          the K9 Tokens and Network to follow the specifications set forth in our Terms and Conditions, and throughout
          or site, and intend to take commercially reasonable steps toward those ends, we may have to make changes to
          the specifications of the K9 Tokens or Network for any number of legitimate reasons.</p>
        <p>This could create the risk that the K9 Tokens or Network, as further developed and maintained, may not meet
          your expectations at the time of Use. Furthermore, despite our good faith efforts to develop and maintain the
          Network, it is still possible that the Network will experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately
          developed or maintained, which may negatively impact the Network and K9 Tokens.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h3><strong>Risk of an Unfavorable Fluctuation of Currency Value</strong></h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>The Group team intends to use the proceeds from the use of K9 Tokens to fund the maintenance and development
          of the Network. The proceeds of the K9 Token transactions, including pools, staking, or reserve Tokens can be
          used by K9 at any time to further enhance the K9 Token. We reserve the right to sell K9 tokens at any time
          that is required in order to meet the objectives of the Group.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h3><strong>Risk of Dissolution of the Group or Network</strong></h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavorable fluctuation
          in the value of cryptographic and fiat currencies, decrease in the K9 Tokens’ utility, the failure of
          commercial relationships, or intellectual property ownership challenges, the Network may no longer be viable
          to operate and the Group may dissolve.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h3><strong>Risks Arising from Lack of Governance Rights</strong></h3>
        <p>Because K9 Tokens confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to the Network or Group or its
          corporate affiliates, all decisions involving the Network or Group will be made by Group at its sole
          discretion, including, but not limited to, decisions to discontinue the Network, to create and sell more K9
          Tokens for use in the Network, or to sell or liquidate the Group. These decisions could adversely affect the
          Network and the K9 Tokens you hold.</p>
        <h3><strong>Risks Involving Cloud Storage</strong></h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>As the Group provides services to individual and institutional clients, including users and applications</p>
        <p>which involves data storage to some extent, the Services are susceptible to a number of risks related to the
          storage of data in the cloud. While the Group does not have access to the contents of the data stored through
          the Services, the Services may involve the storage of large amounts of sensitive and/or proprietary
          information, which may be compromised in the event of a cyber- attack or other malicious activity. Similarly,
          the Services may be interrupted and files may become temporarily unavailable in the event of such an attack or
          malicious activity. Because users can use a variety of hardware and software that may interface with the
          Network, there is the risk that the Services may become unavailable or interrupted based on a failure of
          interoperability or an inability to integrate these third- party systems and devices that the Group does not
          control with the Group’s Services. The risk that the Services may face increasing interruptions and the
          Network may face additional security vulnerabilities could adversely affect the Network and therefore the
          future utility of any K9 Tokens that you hold.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h3><strong>Unanticipated Risks</strong></h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>Cryptographic K9 Tokens such as these K9 Tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks
          included in this Exhibit C, there are other risks associated with your Use, holding and use of K9 Tokens,
          including those that the Group cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated
          variations or combinations of the risks discussed in this Exhibit C.</p>
